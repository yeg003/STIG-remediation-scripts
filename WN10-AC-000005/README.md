# 🛡️ Manual Fix – STIG ID: WN10-AC-000005

## 📌 Title:
Account Lockout Duration Must Be Set to 15 Minutes or Greater

---

## 🖥️ Description:
This STIG requires that the account lockout duration be set to **15 minutes or greater**, or to **0**, which requires an administrator to manually unlock the account. This setting helps prevent brute-force login attacks by enforcing a timeout after repeated failed login attempts.
