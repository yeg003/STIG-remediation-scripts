## 📌 Title:
Prevent ICMP Redirects from Overriding OSPF Routes

---

## 🖥️ Description:
This STIG requires that **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects** be **disabled** so they do not override routes generated by **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**. Allowing ICMP redirects can lead to improper routing of network traffic.
